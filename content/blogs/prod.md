## I pushed to prod today

Here's the story 

```
> the excitement and thrill of watching the PR merge... 

> the stress watching the CI/CD pipeline run...

> the confusion not seeing the frontend change because the pipeline actually kind of sucks...

> the relief when it finally changes on the 40th refresh...

> the pounding in the chest watching the logs stream in... 

> the terror seeing the missing environment variables in prod... 

> the shame as the type errors flood the logs...

> the laughter as we revert to the previous working pipeline... 
```

there's no feeling like it :)
